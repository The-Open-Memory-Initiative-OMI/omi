# The Open Memory Initiative (OMI)

The Open Memory Initiative (OMI) is a community-driven effort to make system memory understandable, reproducible, and buildable.

OMI focuses on opening the memory stack through careful documentation, open design, and reproducible validation, starting with mature PC DDR technologies.

## Status

The project charter has been published.

Initial v1 technical decisions and groundwork are in progress, including:
- Locking the v1 memory target (DDR3 vs DDR4)
- Defining initial validation platforms
- Establishing contribution workflows

This is an early-stage, engineering-first project.

## What OMI Is (and Is Not)

OMI is:
- An open, community-driven engineering initiative
- Focused on reproducible, real-world memory designs
- Charter-first and documentation-heavy
- Incremental and scope-disciplined

OMI is not:
- A commercial product
- A vendor-specific effort
- A research paper or whitepaper
- A closed or NDA-gated project

---

## License

Licensing details will be added as the project progresses.

Until then, all contributions are expected to comply with the openness and redistribution principles defined in the project charter.

---

## Questions and Discussion

Questions, ideas, and clarifications should be raised through:
- GitHub Issues for actionable topics
- GitHub Discussions for open-ended conversation

Clear questions help build a clear project.

**OMI values careful, transparent engineering over speed.**
