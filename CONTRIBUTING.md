# **Contributing to the Open Memory Initiative (OMI)**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Open Memory Initiative.

OMI is a technical, community-driven effort to make system memory understandable, reproducible, and buildable. Contributions are expected to prioritize clarity, correctness, and openness.

This document describes how to participate effectively.

---

## **Guiding Principles**

All contributions must align with the principles defined in the project charter.

In particular:

* Work must be openly documented

* No NDA-protected or proprietary information may be used

* All assumptions must be stated explicitly

* Reproducibility is a requirement, not a bonus

If a contribution cannot be shared publicly in full, it does not belong in OMI.

---

## **Ways to Contribute**

OMI welcomes contributions in multiple forms, including:

* Electrical design and schematics

* PCB layout and stack-up design

* Signal integrity analysis and documentation

* Validation, testing, and bring-up procedures

* Documentation and design rationale

* Review of existing designs and documents

* Identification of risks, gaps, or errors

You do not need prior DDR experience to contribute. You do need to document your work clearly.

---

## **How to Get Started**

1. Read the project charter in `CHARTER.md`

2. Review open issues and discussions

3. Comment on an issue to indicate interest or propose an approach

4. Ask clarifying questions early and in public

If you are unsure where to start, look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`.

---

## **Contribution Workflow**

All changes are made through pull requests.

1. Fork the repository

2. Create a new branch for your work

3. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commits

4. Open a pull request against the `main` branch

5. Describe what you changed and why

6. Reference any related issues

Pull requests are reviewed based on technical merit, clarity, and alignment with project scope.

---

## **Documentation Expectations**

Documentation is part of the contribution.

Depending on the type of work, contributions should include:

* Design intent and assumptions

* Constraints and trade-offs

* Tool versions and environments used

* Test conditions and results where applicable

If something is uncertain or unverified, state it explicitly.

---

## **Validation and Testing Contributions**

If your contribution involves testing or measurement, include:

* Platform details (CPU, chipset, motherboard)

* Memory type and configuration

* Tools and equipment used

* Test procedures

* Observed results, including failures

Partial results are acceptable if clearly labeled.

---

## **Legal and IP Boundaries**

Do not contribute:

* NDA-protected information

* Proprietary reference designs

* Licensed IP that cannot be redistributed

* Reverse-engineered confidential material

If you are unsure whether something is acceptable, raise the concern in an issue before contributing.

---

## **Review Process**

Reviews are conducted in public.

Feedback may include requests for clarification, additional documentation, or changes to improve reproducibility. This is part of the engineering process.

Maintainers may request revisions before merging.

---

## **Code of Conduct**

All contributors are expected to interact respectfully and professionally.

Technical disagreement is encouraged. Personal attacks, harassment, or exclusionary behavior are not tolerated.

---

## **Questions**

If you have questions about contributing, open an issue or start a discussion.

Clear questions help build a clear project.

---

**OMI values careful, transparent engineering over speed.**  
 **If that aligns with how you like to work, you are welcome here.**
