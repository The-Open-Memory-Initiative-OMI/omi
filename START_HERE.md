# Start Here

Welcome to the Open Memory Initiative.

OMI is building an **open, reference-quality DDR4 UDIMM** — from architecture decisions through schematic capture, validation, and documentation. Everything is public, everything is documented, and every decision has a rationale you can read.

This guide will help you understand the project, find your way around the repository, and start contributing.

## What OMI is building

OMI v1 targets a **DDR4 UDIMM** (desktop unbuffered DIMM):

- **8 GB total**, single rank (1R), x8 DRAM devices, non-ECC (64-bit bus)
- DDR4 UDIMM form factor (chosen for debuggability, platform access, and reproducibility)
- Host-supplied power rails (VDD, VDDQ, VPP) — no on-DIMM regulation
- SPD EEPROM for module identification

This is not a commercial product. It is a **reference-quality engineering artifact** designed to be understood, reviewed, and reproduced.

---

## How the project is structured

OMI follows a **staged engineering methodology**. Each stage builds on the previous one, and nothing moves forward until the current stage is documented and reviewable.

| Stage | Name | Status |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 5 | Architecture Decisions | ✅ Locked |
| 6 | Block Decomposition | ✅ Core blocks documented |
| 7 | Schematic Capture | ✅ 7.1–7.5 frozen; 7.7 closure complete |
| 8 | Validation & Review | 🔄 In progress |
| 9 | Minimal Reference Schematic | ⏳ Upcoming |
| 10 | Layout & SI/PI Guidelines | ⏳ Upcoming |

To understand the full engineering philosophy, read:

📄 **[How OMI Is Engineered](./docs/how_omi_is_engineered.md)** — the canonical reference for the staged process, design philosophy, and what "success" means for OMI.

## Recommended reading order

If you're new, follow this path:

1. **[How OMI Is Engineered](./docs/how_omi_is_engineered.md)** — understand the methodology and philosophy
2. **[CHARTER.md](./CHARTER.md)** — understand the project's scope, principles, and governance
3. **[Stage 5 decisions](./docs/05_architecture_decisions/)** — why DDR4, why UDIMM, why 8 GB 1R x8
4. **[Stage 6 blocks](./docs/06_block_decomposition/)** — how the DIMM is decomposed into reviewable subsystems
5. **[Stage 7 schematics](./docs/07_schematic_capture/)** — the actual schematic-level design artifacts

You do not need to read everything before contributing. But you should understand the stage your work touches.

## Pick a track

OMI has three contribution tracks. You can contribute meaningfully regardless of your background.

### ⚡ Track 1 — Developers (tooling + automation + docs)

You can contribute without touching hardware.

**What you'll do:**
- Build linters and checkers (naming rules, consistency checks, schema validation)
- Improve documentation pipelines (doc generation, CI, templates)
- Create traceability helpers that connect specs → schematics → validation

**Good fit if you like:** Python, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, docs engineering, automation.

**Starter tasks:**
- Validate that all Stage 7 docs reference the correct artifact filenames
- Build a script that checks the pin map CSV for duplicates or missing entries
- Add a CI check that all markdown files have a `## Status` field

---

### 🔍 Track 2 — Reviewers (correctness + clarity + scope enforcement)

You help keep OMI coherent.

**What you'll do:**
- Review docs and specs for internal consistency and missing assumptions
- Check that decisions are justified and properly scoped
- Turn observations into structured review notes and actionable issues

**Good fit if you like:** systems thinking, correctness, design review, documentation quality.

**Starter tasks:**
- Read a Stage 6 block doc and check whether all stated assumptions are also reflected in Stage 7
- Review the Stage 7 closure doc and verify the artifact index is complete and links resolve
- Identify any decision that lacks an explicit rationale and open an issue

---

### 🧪 Track 3 — Testers (validation evidence + reproducible reports)

You turn designs into reality checks.

**What you'll do:**
- Run validation steps on real desktop platforms
- Submit structured test reports (platform details, procedure, results, failures)
- Help build the validation matrix (what works where, and why)

**Good fit if you like:** hardware bring-up, debugging, measurement discipline, reporting.

**Starter tasks:**
- Document your available test platform (CPU, chipset, motherboard, BIOS version)
- Review the Stage 8 validation checklists and flag any unclear or untestable items
- Propose a bring-up procedure for verifying SPD detection on a commodity desktop

## How to contribute

All contributions go through pull requests or issues.

### For documentation, tooling, or design changes:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your work
3. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commits
4. Open a pull request against `main`
5. Describe what you changed and why
6. Reference any related issues

### For review findings or validation reports:

Open an **Issue** using the appropriate template, including:
- What you reviewed or tested
- What you found (with specifics)
- What you recommend

Full details are in **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

## Task labels

When browsing issues, look for these labels:

| Label | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `good-first-issue` | Easy entry point — good for first-time contributors |
| `review-needed` | Needs a reviewer to check correctness, clarity, or completeness |
| `test-needed` | Needs validation on real hardware or structured test evidence |
| `docs` | Documentation improvement or addition |
| `tooling` | CI, automation, scripts, or infrastructure work |

---

## What OMI expects from contributors

OMI is not a fast-moving project. It is a careful one.

- **Document your assumptions.** If something is uncertain, say so explicitly.
- **Reproducibility is required**, not optional. If someone else can't follow your work, it isn't done.
- **No NDA-protected or proprietary material.** If it can't be shared publicly, it doesn't belong here.
- **Review is part of the process.** Feedback is technical, not personal. Expect it and welcome it.
- **Scope discipline matters.** OMI v1 is a DDR4 UDIMM. Proposals outside that scope are deferred, not dismissed.

## Not sure where to start?

Open a Discussion titled:

**"I want to contribute — help me pick a starter task"**

Include:
- Your background and skills

- Whether you have access to a desktop DDR4 platform for testing

Someone will help you find the right entry point.
